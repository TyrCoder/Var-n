# ✅ SELLER DASHBOARD ENHANCEMENTS - ALL COMPLETE

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Product Approval System ✅
**Problem:** Sellers couldn't see pending product status
**Solution:** Added approval_status tracking to products table
- New products start as "pending"
- Admin can "approve" (visible to buyers) or "reject" (stays in database)
- Sellers see clear status for each product

### 2. Four Status Cards ✅
**Dashboard now displays:**
- Approved: Count of approved products (green)
- Pending Approval: Count waiting for admin review (yellow)
- Rejected: Count of rejected products (red)
- Total Products: Sum of all products (gray)

### 3. Consolidated Account Settings ✅
**Before:** Two separate pages ("Brand Settings" and "Account")
**After:** Single "Account Settings" page with:
- Brand Information section (name, description, contact, address, location)
- Personal Account section (name, phone, email)

### 4. Brand Description Support ✅
**Signup:** Sellers can add brand description during registration
**Account Settings:** Editable anytime after signup
**Displays:** In their seller profile
